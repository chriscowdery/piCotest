piCotest 0.1

About
-----
piCotest is inspired from of minuint (http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html) in so far as that it's easy to include in existing projects without installing libraries.
Above all else, it's designed to be lightweight and simple.

Usage
-----
1. Create an empty C file
2. #include "picotest.c"
3. Create a void * test method (e.g. void *testOne() { ... } )
4. Inside the method, use TEST_ASSERT("String Description here", truthExpressionToEvaluateHere);
5. In your main method, use the addTestMethod to add your test to the suite (e.g. addTest(testOne);)
6. When done adding tests, invoke executeTestSuite();

Coming Soon
-----------
1. setUp and tearDowns for tests
2. Resetting after each test
3. Dynamically expanding the number of tests
